# enigma
Project 1 of CS61B Fall 2021

Background:
This project was a complex exercise in useful data structures and object-oriented programming. I constructed a working replicate of the German Enigma machine used in World War II to encrypt messages. Enigma fundamentally works through substitution ciphers - a one-to-one mapping of the alphabet onto itself. The device consists of several mechanisms. Interchangeable rotors sit side-by-side on a shaft, most having 26 contacts. To the left of rotors are reflectors. Each rotor and reflector implements a different permutation. Rotors move with ratchets that can only be moved with spring-loaded pawls. All of these characteristics were modelled and implemented in Java.
